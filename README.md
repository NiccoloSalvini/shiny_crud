# Shiny Crud

These are basic examples of Shiny apps performing CRUD (**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete) database operations.

I added CRUD functionalities to a dataset containing some interesting facts happened in the past that can be potentially relevant!

I am always looking to improve myself, feel free to suggest!
