# Shiny Crud

These are basic examples of Shiny apps performing CRUD (**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete) database operations. In this case I used a Posgresql db on a Heroku instance to store and retrieve data which are then loaded into the shiny app dockerized and hosted into GCP.

I added CRUD functionalities to a dataset containing some interesting facts happened in the past that can be potentially relevant!

I am always looking to improve myself, feel free to suggest!
